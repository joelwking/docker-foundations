# :whale: Docker Foundations Hands-On

!!! quote
    "*Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.*"
    *~ wikipedia*

## Overview

This Hands-On walk-through is designed to provide you real-world exposure to the foundational Docker instructions needed to build a Docker image and integrate it with Visual Studio Code.  The outcome from this lab is both knowledge of building Docker containers plus the added benefit of learning how to utilize the container as your development environment when using Visual Studio Code.

Here are some additional resources available:
