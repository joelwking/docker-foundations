# Wrap up

The goal of this walk-through was to provide you real-world, hands-on exposure to building a Docker image.  This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what you can with Docker and Dockerfiles.  You can take these same steps for you future projects and modify where needed to meet the needs of the project.
